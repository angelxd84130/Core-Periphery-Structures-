# Core-periphery structure analysis and visualization

1. Python packages used: matplotlib, pandas, cpalgorithm, networkx

2. Motivation: Project idea 2.2.3, It is important to maintain a who-trusts-whom network for block-chain based technologies such as bitcoins.
Core-periphery structures might help in detection of anomalies in transactions, or observe network-level transaction trends in crypto-currencies.

5. Changes to the dataset: We modify the dataset format from integer to variable for the first two columns in order to fit in the requirement of generating a graph using networkx.

6. In order to install the packages all succuessfully, the user has to install a c++ complier before pip install operation. Otherwise, the required packages are not allowed to be installed into your environment.
